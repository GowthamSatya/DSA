Prim's Algorithm for minimum spanning tree
-- Greedy Algorithm
-- Used for weighted undirected graphs
-- We use priority queue data structure


Terms
== MST set = [] -->  all nodes that are included in MST
== Active Edge = edge from vertex in MST Set to set V
== MST Edge = edge that has been included in MST tree


==== Algorithm ====

1. Start from any source vertex
2. Find all the active edges from that source
3. Out of all active edges we pick the one with least weight
   --> add that vertex to MST set
   --> add active edges from that new source to active edge list
4. Repeat step-2 until all vertices are added to MST set.
